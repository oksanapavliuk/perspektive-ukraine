          Perspektive Ukraine e.V. supports the people of Ukraine in their struggle against the Russian invasion 
          and in their efforts to rebuild the torn country, for a free, strong and blossoming Ukraine.  
          <br/> <br/> 
          Russia’s war of aggression is aimed at destroying Ukraine’s sovereignty and at subordinating Ukraine 
          under Russia’s dictatorial regime.  Russia pursues this aim with all available means, militarily through invasion and occupation, 
          economically through the destruction of infrastructure, psychologically through murder, rape, and torture.  
          <br/> <br/> 
          Ukraine resists the aggression with heart and mind, backbone, and endurance.  
          So far Ukraine’s resistance is successful and it must remain so.  
          This is a conflict that will shape the destiny of generations, the destiny of Europe, 
          the destiny of mankind in the 21st century.  
          “Never send to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee”.
          <br/><br/> 
          Our support is particularly directed at the work of those who have stayed in Ukraine or have returned home 
          to protect and to help, to tend and to feed.  And to rebuild where the aggressors retract, schools and hospitals, 
          homes and farms, factories and workshops, streets, public water systems and power supplies.

        <div class="smallstripe"></div>
        <h3>Humanitarian Relief Supplies and Emergency Medicine</h3>
        <p>
        Where the war is raging, food and drinking water, clothing and hygiene products, and especially emergency medical supplies are dierly needed. <br><br>

          Soldiers and civilians are dying because the supply of tourniquets, dressing materials, styptic and antibacterial drugs is not keeping pace.
          <br><br>
          We are buying what is most urgently required and deliver it to where it is needed.
          We organize the entire chain of transport and ensure that everything reaches its destination. 
        </p>
          
         <h3>Noodle packets for soup kitchens in Kharkiv - Ukraine</h3>
        <p>
          Andrii Shorokhov has a small noodle production in Kharkiv. <br><br>
          With the money donated, he buys the ingredients, produces the noodles 
          and distributes them free of charge to the soup kitchens in Kharkiv. 
          The people who no longer have a home due to the bombing or who simply can no longer afford it, can get food there. <br><br>
          For every euro donated, a pack of pasta can be brought to someone who urgently needs it.
          To make a specific donation to this project, please mention "Nudeln für Charkiw" in the reference.   
        </p>

        <h3>Children Summer Camp</h3>
        <p>
          For the children, life needs to go on. We are organizing summer camps for them in peaceful environs 
          providing opportunity to learn, play and do sports.

        <h3>Mini Hydroelectric Power Stations</h3>
        <p>
          According to official estimates, the war will shrink Ukraine's economy by 45%.  <br>
          We must stabilise the economy. This cannot wait, we must start now.
          <br><br>
          We aim to make a small but significant contribution by building local power supply infrastructure.  
          At the heart of the effort will be the construction of mini hydro power stations providing local power autonomy. <br>
